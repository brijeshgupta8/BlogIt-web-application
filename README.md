BloggIt
BloggIt is a simple and intuitive blogging platform that allows users to create, edit, and delete blog posts. The application is built with Node.js and Express, utilizing EJS for server-side rendering to dynamically generate HTML content.

Features
Create Posts: Users can create new blog posts with a title and content. The creation form is user-friendly and validates input to ensure completeness.
Edit Posts: Existing blog posts can be edited to update the title or content. The edit form pre-populates with the current post data for easy modifications.
Delete Posts: Users can delete blog posts they no longer need, ensuring their content remains relevant and up-to-date.
Post Listing: All blog posts are listed on the main page, with titles and brief excerpts of content. Users can click on a post title to view the full content of the post.
Post Details: Each blog post has its own detail page, displaying the full title and content of the post.
Server-Side Rendering with EJS
BloggIt uses EJS (Embedded JavaScript) for server-side rendering. This approach allows for dynamic content generation on the server before sending HTML to the client's browser.

Benefits of Server-Side Rendering with EJS
SEO Friendly: Server-side rendering ensures that search engines can easily index your content, improving SEO.
Faster Initial Load: The initial HTML is fully rendered on the server, allowing for faster load times on the client-side.
Simplified Development: EJS syntax is simple and integrates seamlessly with Express, making it easier to build dynamic web applications.
EJS Usage in BloggIt
Templates: EJS templates are used to create reusable components for the header, footer, and main content areas.
Dynamic Content: Data passed from the server to the templates allows for dynamic content generation. For example, the list of blog posts and post details are rendered dynamically based on the data provided by the server.
Partial Views: Common elements like navigation bars and footers are included in multiple pages using EJS partials, promoting code reuse and maintainability.
